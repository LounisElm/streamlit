# Streamlit Movie Recommender

This repository contains a simple Streamlit application demonstrating a movie recommendation system.

The app lets you search for movies and view personalized recommendations. Movie posters are displayed with a **Description** button that opens a modal window showing genres, duration, main actors and average rating from MovieLens.
