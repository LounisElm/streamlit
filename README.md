# Streamlit Movie Recommender

This repository contains a simple Streamlit application demonstrating a movie recommendation system.

The app lets you search for movies and view personalized recommendations. Movie posters are displayed with a **Description** button for more info.

The original version could optionally show YouTube trailers when a `TMDB_API_KEY` was provided. This feature has been removed to simplify the interface.
